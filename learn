Blockchain:
===========
a blockc contains 
	1) data
	2) hash
	3) hash of previous block 

1)data:
-------
The data is depends on the type of blockchain 

example:
	a bitcoin have the following 
	
	->From 
	->To 
	->Amount

2) hash:
--------
you can compare a hash with a fingerprint which is unique

once a block is created the hash is calculated , changing something inside the block can change the hash 


3) hash of previous block:
--------------------------

creates the chain between the blocks 



example:
 
block1                       block2                          block3 

hash: 1Z8F                  hash: 6BQ1                       hash: 3H4Q
previous_hash: 0000         previous_hash: 1Z8F		     previous_hash: 6BQ1
